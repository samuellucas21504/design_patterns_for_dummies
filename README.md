# First example of the book
## Ducks and Behaviors

In this example it is explained how, when you know that a piece of code will repeat it self between multiple classes, but will have different implementations in between each other, you should separate the behaviors/methods into separate classes and program while looking
into a interface.

If you examine the code, you will see that we have multiple classes for multiple QuackBehaviors and FlyBehaviors, but only a base abstract class that implements it's methods.
